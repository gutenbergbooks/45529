<p class="ph4">THE NEW HEN.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A Fable.</i>)</p>

<p>A New Hen wandering disconsolately in a country farmyard once made the
acquaintance of a cock of the old school, when both fell into some
discourse concerning the changes of the modes.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the former, arrogantly addressing the latter, "times are
indeed a good deal altered since you were a cockerel, and all for the
better, thank goodness! Time was, and not so very long ago either, when
I was expected to do nothing save lay eggs and breed chickens: now,
however, my mistress must know better than to expect such degrading
offices of me, for I will neither lay the one nor breed the other."</p>

<p>The old cock was about to offer some remarks in ridicule of these
sentiments, when the housewife came into the yard, and, snatching up
the New Hen, wrung her neck, remarking to herself as she did so, that
a fowl that could neither lay eggs nor rear chickens, had obviously no
place in the economy of nature.</p>

<p class="ph4">THE MENU À LA MODE.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Come, <span class="smcap">Damon</span>, since again we've met<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We'll feast right royally to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The groaning table shall be set<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With every seasonable delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The luscious bivalve ... I forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The oyster is an arch-deceiver,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And makes its eater's certain lot<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A bad attack of typhoid fever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With soup then, be it thick or clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The banquet fitly may commence&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas, on second thoughts, I fear<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With soup as well we must dispense.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The doctors urge that, in effect.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Soup simply kills the thoughtless glutton,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's full of germs. I recollect<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They say the same of beef and mutton.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yes, each variety of meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As you remark, is much the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we're forbidden now to eat<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fish, oysters, poultry, joint or game.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But though a Nemesis each brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The punishment, the doctors tell, is<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As nothing to the awful things<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Awaiting all who toy with jellies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Cheese&mdash;that is not condemned with these?"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet ample evidence we find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To make us, <span class="smcap">Damon</span>, look on cheese<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As simply poison to mankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While those who may desire to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Immediately o'er Charon's ferry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have but to take a daily glass<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of claret, hock, champagne or sherry.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And therefore, <span class="smcap">Damon</span>, you and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who fain would live a year at least,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reluctantly must modify<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The scope of our projected feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A charcoal biscuit we will share,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Water (distilled, of course,) we'll swallow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since this appears the only fare<br /></span>

<p class="ph4">SHAKSPEARE REVISED BY AN ALDERMAN.</p>

<p>"May I ask," said the worthy Alderman <span class="smcap">Davies</span>, and he might
have added, "I ask because '<i><span class="smcap">Davies</span> sum, non &OElig;dipus</i>'"&mdash;but
he didn't, and it was a chance lost, "what salary you [the witness
under examination] received for this conduct of yours while secretary?"
To which witness answered, "£500 a year, and a bonus of £200."
Whereupon the Alderman remarked, "Then all I can say is, you could have
got many honest men to do the work for much less."</p>

<p>Quite so, Mr. Alderman, true for you; but if a man will act honestly
for a sovereign, what might not the addition of ten shillings do?
It ought to make him more honest comparatively, while another ten
shillings would make him superlatively honest. But how if there were an
obligation attached to the increase? Just a trifling deviation out of
the straight course to begin with, to oblige a patron?</p>

<p>Let honesty be the drug in the market, and the rare herb dishonesty
will be at a premium. It is gratifying to be assured, on aldermanic
authority, that <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> was wrong, and that in future for
<i>Hamlet's</i> well-known dictum, "For to be honest as this world goes is
to be as one man picked out of ten thousand," we must read "For to be
dishonest as this world goes is to be as one man picked out of ten
thousand."</p>

<p>Happy Alderman <span class="smcap">Davies</span>! In what paradisiacal pastures must he
have moved and breathed and earned his livelihood!</p>

<p class="ph4">THE DRAMATIC COMMON SENSER-SHIP.</p>

<p>Last week the name of Mr. <span class="smcap">Redford</span> as newly-appointed Licenser
of Plays was announced. This is just to the late Licenser's assistant
and deputy. But if the office is to be continued, why should it not be
thrown open to competitive examination? A paper of such questions as
the following would secure a learned Theban for the office:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Who was the Licenser of Plays in the time of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>?</p>

<p>2. Translate passages (given) from (&#945;) French dramatists,
(&#946;) Italian, (&#947;) German, (&#948;) Spanish,
(&#949;) Norwegian, (&#950;) Russian, (&#7953;) Japanese.</p>

<p>3. Translate passages (given) from the works of English dramatists into
the above-mentioned languages.</p>

<p>4. Give your opinion on the following "situations" and "plots," and say
whether you consider it in the interests of public morality that they
should be licensed for performance or not.</p>

<p>5. State your reasons for such opinions.</p>

<p>6. Is it your opinion that an officer of the Licensing (Play)
Department should be in attendance every night at every theatre (a
stall being kept for him by the manager on pain of fine or forfeiture
of licence) to note if any change or any introduction be made in the
dialogue or in any part or portion of the play already licensed? And if
not, why not?</p>

<p>7. Would it be, or not, advisable in your opinion that every author, or
all the authors when collaborating, should read their own pieces aloud
to the Licenser, giving as much action and dramatic illustration as
space will allow? And that the low comedians and eccentric comedians,
male and female, with songs and dances, should attend, and show (<i>a</i>)
what steps they propose taking in the new piece, (<i>b</i>) what words,
(<i>c</i>) winks, (<i>d</i>) becks, and (<i>e</i>) wreathed smiles they intend giving
in order to point an innuendo or adorn an apparently harmless joke?</p>

<p>8. Do you think that, as an assistant judge on such occasions, one or
more experts (at so much an hour) should be present?</p>

<p>9. (<i>a</i>) In your opinion should not every play be <i>seen</i> by the
Licenser, duly acted, with the costumes, before a licence can be
granted? (<i>b</i>) and then that the licence be granted only on the
condition that no alteration in word or action be made at any time, and
under no pretence whatever, during the run, on pain of forfeiture of
licence?</p>

<p>The above suggestions will serve as a foundation for some future
Licensing Exam.-paper.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of the "Sp-ct-tor."</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sure you will be glad to have another veracious
story about Animal Etiquette. During the recent frost we hung a bone up
in the garden for the starving birds to peck at, and one of our dogs&mdash;a
collie&mdash;was mean enough to steal it. Next day we noticed him limping,
and were surprised to find a great gash across one of his paws. I at
once understood what had happened. Our other dogs had evidently thought
stealing the bone under the circumstances was very bad form, <i>and the
collie had been cut by them!</i></p>


<p class="center">Yours sympathetically,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I find that even kittens have a code of etiquette, and
understand the niceties of social rank. The other day our kitten was on
the table, when a winged creature which I took for a fly settled just
in front of it. Pussy immediately gracefully retreated backwards till,
on arriving at the edge, she slid to the ground. At first I put down
her behaviour to fright, but it was nothing of the sort. It was a pure
act of courtesy. <i>The supposed fly was a lady-bird!</i> Our intelligent
little animal had shown her instinctive respect for title and sex,
which was naturally very gratifying to an ardent</p>

<p class="ph4">VADE MECUM FOR A CERTAIN COURT OFFICIAL.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Your duty, I believe, is to protect the public from
receiving impressions&mdash;from your point of view&mdash;of a pernicious
character?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly; and this I accomplish by reading and rejecting
what I think the public should avoid.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How long has the office been in existence?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> About a century or so.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How did the public get on before your office came into existence?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Fairly well, especially in the days of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Had the Bard of Avon to obtain a licence for the production of his
plays?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; they were then practically edited by the public.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Could not the public edit plays in the reign of Queen
<span class="smcap">Victoria</span> with the intelligence displayed in the days of "Good
Queen <span class="smcap">Bess</span>"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is impossible to say, as the question has not been tested by
experiment.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You say that your duty is to preserve the purity of the public
taste; was that also the object of the earlier of your predecessors?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Seemingly not, as the office was called into existence to serve
as a bar to the dissemination of opinions of an entirely political
character.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But that is not now the <i>raison d'être</i> of the appointment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, no; for nowadays, thanks to the newspapers, politics enjoys
free trade.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But still, the right of interference exists?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, but it is only used to prevent a performer from "making up"
as a Cabinet Minister, to the annoyance of the right hon. gentleman
favoured with the attention.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any rule to guide the use of the official blue pencil?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> None in particular. That emblem of concrete authority may be
diligently used for a decade, and then be laid aside for a quarter of a
century.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then there is no policy in the office?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> None to speak of. What was wrong in 1875 may be right in 1895, and
may be wrong again at the commencement of the next century.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But purely such an office has not gained the entire applause of
the London Press?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> On the contrary, the all but universal condemnation.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And yet when the office became vacant there were many journalistic
applicants?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because journalists accept the situation of the hour, and make the
best of it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it possible that the candidates who have failed may find their
objection to the existence of the office stronger than ever?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is not only possible, but probable.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And thus any non-journalist who accepts the appointment may not
have a very pleasant time of it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So it would appear to the casual observer.</p>

<p class="ph4"><i>MY</i> INFLUENZA.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;This is the day I promised to go with my aunt to the first
meeting of that new Society for the Propagation of Female Suffrage
amongst the Turks. Wish I'd never promised. Don't see how I can escape.
Why, yes, good idea&mdash;the influenza! I'll have it. Almost fancy I have
a slight pain in my back, which would certainly be a symptom. I will
decide that I have a pain in my back. Send note, saying, in uncertain
weather caution is necessary; fear that I'm attacked by the prevailing
epidemic; wish every success to the good cause, and so forth. Then,
relieved in my mind, down to the club, and forget all about the old
lady.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Shall have a melancholy time this evening. Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Pogson's</span> At Home, with recitations. Oh lord! Daren't offend
old <span class="smcap">Pogson</span> by refusing. It would not be so bad if there were
not the five Miss <span class="smcap">Pogsons</span>. Of all the awful, middle-aged young
women&mdash;&mdash;! Ha, by Jove! Never thought of it. Of course. The influenza.
Telegraph at once. Deeply regret, illness, and so forth. I really have
a slight pain in my back. Wonder what it is. Put on my thickest coat
when I go out.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Awful joke this influenza. Shall escape old
<span class="smcap">Blodgett's</span> dinner to-night. Should have been bored to death.
Now sixpenny telegram settles it all. The only thing is I really have
a pain in my back. Reminds me of boy crying "Wolf" in the fable. Shall
stay in this evening, and keep warm by the fire.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Do not feel much worse, but pain still there. Shall not
venture out. Can therefore, quite truthfully, excuse my absence from
<span class="smcap">Boreham's</span> <i>matinée</i>. Good enough fellow, <span class="smcap">Boreham</span>, but
can't write a tragedy at all. So shall escape the awful infliction of
his mixed imitation of <span class="smcap">Ibsen</span> and <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. The worst
of it is that, with this beastly pain in my back, I begin to think
my influenza is no sham at all. Stop in all day in warm room. In the
evening feel headache, as well as pain in back. Fear the worst.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;No doubt about it. In bed. Must see the doctor. Letter
from <span class="smcap">Gadsby</span>. Wants me to go to the theatre to-night. Jolly
party. Supper after at his house. Little dance to finish with. Jolly,
lively fellow <span class="smcap">Gadsby</span>. Knows lots of pretty actresses, and
has all sorts of larks. Would have been good fun. And here am I in
bed! Hang the influenza! But cannot risk anything. Get <span class="smcap">Jones</span>
fetched&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jones, M.D.</span>, my old chum. Tell him how I feel, and
say I have the influenza. "Bosh!" says he, "you've been sitting in a
draught somewhere, and got a little lumbago in your back. It's nothing.
And you've stuck in a hot room till you've got a headache for want of
fresh air. Get up and go out as soon as you can." Feel better already.
Show him <span class="smcap">Gadsby's</span> letter. "The very thing," says he; "I'm
going. We'll go together. With that influenza of yours, you oughtn't to
go out without someone to watch the case."</p>

Appears that enterprising book-shop, resort of fashionable world for

Letters (and also Mr. <span class="smcap">Le Gallienne</span>) asking for short list
of best neglected books. Find that answers cover fairly wide ground,
from <span class="smcap">Homer</span> to New English Dictionary. Feeling that it might
please general public to have some expression of opinion from various
defunct authors described with faint praise as undeservedly neglected,
and finding it inconvenient to arrange personal interview, by reason
of distance and other difficulties, have sent out circular requesting
that they would interview themselves on the subject and kindly let me

<p class="ph4">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</p>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, March 11.</i>&mdash;A great cloud fallen over
House to-day. Soon the stately presence that fills the Chair will step
forth, never to return. The sonorous voice that can still the storm in
its angriest mood will no more resound through the hushed Chamber. The
best Speaker the House of Commons in its long history has known, will
be merged in the mediocrity of the House of Lords. A hard succession of
blows to fall on an assembly. First Mr. G., then <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>,
and now <span class="smcap">Arthur Peel</span>, three men of wholly varied type, each
unique, in his way reaching the highest level.</p>

<p>Suppose we shall get along somehow, though for all concerned in
business of House, in maintaining its usefulness and supporting its
dignity, the future without <span class="smcap">Peel</span> in the Chair not to be
regarded without foreboding. He has every quality and gift that go
to make the ideal Speaker. A noble presence, a fine voice, a courtly
manner, a resolute will, a full knowledge of the forms of the House,
a keen though decently suppressed sense of humour&mdash;a scholar and a
gentleman. These things are seen and recognised from outside. Only
those who live and work in the House of Commons know how marvellous is
the combination, how infinite in its magnitude the loss impending.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Talk to-night all about successor to the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>.
A dozen names mentioned; general conclusion that whoever may be
selected, he's not to be envied. The Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, turning
up to-night for first time this Session, brings strange news. Has been
on the Riviera, daily expecting influenza. Saw Mr. G. yesterday; the
talk at Cap Martin, as here, all about the soon-to-be emptied Chair,
and who is to fill it. <span class="smcap">Sark</span> tells me he is quite certain Mr.
G. is thinking of coming forward as candidate; is (so <span class="smcap">Sark</span>
says, and he is a most reliable person) evidently eating out his heart
in voluntary retirement. Now he's got his Psalter out, doesn't know
what to do next.</p>

<p>"I asked him," <span class="smcap">Sark</span> says, "whether there was any precedent for
an ex-Prime Minister, however young in years and untamed in energy,
becoming Speaker."</p>

<p>"Not exactly," he said; "but there is the case of a Speaker who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> became
Prime Minister. <span class="smcap">Addington</span>, you will remember, Speaker in 1789,
was Premier at the turn of the century. It was said of him, by the way,
that he never quite overcame the force of old habits. When engaged with
the Cabinet in consideration of foreign affairs he had difficulty in
refraining from saying 'The French to the right, the Austrians to the
left.' Don't see why the case shouldn't be taken the other way about,
and an ex-Premier become Speaker. Fancy I may take it that I have
some qualifications for the post. Know the House pretty intimately;
have been familiar with it for some years. Am told I never looked so
picturesque as when, on public occasions, I wore official gown of
Chancellor of Exchequer. Think the Speaker's dress would suit me. But
that a mere trifle. What I hanker after, at my time of life, at the
close of a career not absolutely free from hard work, is some post not
too arduous. Seems to me the Speakership would be the very thing; just
enough to do, and not too much."</p>

days in his bedroom with a cold. The cold must have had most amusing
companion, that is if <span class="smcap">Cawmel</span> was as pawky with it as he was
to-night with the semi-military horde led by Private <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span>,
who swooped down and barred approach to Committee, These deployed in

expect. Never suspected <span class="smcap">Silomio</span> in ambush.</p>

<p>As soon as questions over, plot disclosed. <span class="smcap">Cochrane</span>, a
harmless, perhaps necessary, man, put up to move adjournment, in order
to discuss the Swazi question. That in itself a stroke of genius. Had
<span class="smcap">Silomio</span> personally moved, game would have seemed too stale.
Probability is forty Members not been found to stand up in support of
motion. Looks much better to have such action taken on one side of
House and supported from the other; invests it with air of impartiality
and unanimity. On challenge from the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, Conservatives
rose in body to support <span class="smcap">Cochrane's</span> request. Having secured
that object, and being on their legs, they strolled out, leaving
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>, <span class="smcap">Sydney Buxton</span>, and about a score
of others all told, to listen to <span class="smcap">Cochrane's</span> urgent message.
Amongst them sat <span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood</span>, with tender gleam in eyes
that roamed with curious intentness about Speaker's chair.</p>

<p>Whilst <span class="smcap">Cochrane</span> spoke, <span class="smcap">Silomio</span> sat with inspired
look on his face, making voluminous notes. He would come on by-and-by.
Let others keep the thing going as long as possible; just when hapless
Ministers thought it was over, and they might get to business, they
should hear a well-known war-whoop; should discover <span class="smcap">Silomio</span>
at the table, in for a good hour's speech. Meanwhile he sat piling
notes upon notes, pausing occasionally to cheer <span class="smcap">Cochrane</span>, anon
humming softly to himself</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under Secretary for Colonies</span> deprecated in public interest
irregular discussion of question at present time. <span class="smcap">Gorst</span>,
hampered by this responsibility, made curiously halting speech.
<span class="smcap">Baden-Powell</span> spoke "as one who had been in South Africa";
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> more gravely repeated <span class="smcap">Sydney
Buxton's</span> warning. Now was <span class="smcap">Silomio's</span> time. But before
he could move <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> was on his feet, positively,
with some commonplaces about respecting Ministerial responsibility,
consenting to close the conversation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silomio</span> gasped for breath; instinctively felt for his assegai;
clutched at his notes dripping with the gore of <span class="smcap">Sydney Buxton</span>.
When he had partially mastered his emotion the amendment was withdrawn
and opportunity had fled.</p>

<p>"<i>Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves</i>," said <span class="smcap">Plunket</span>
soothingly. "But never mind. You remember that in the end
<span class="smcap">Virgil</span> got his own, and <span class="smcap">Bathylius</span> was basted."
<span class="smcap">Silomio</span> stared.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Silomio</span> contrives a debate and others talk.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Policemen in lobby much startled by incident that
preceded arrival of <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> to resume sittings at nine
o'clock. The steady tramp of a column in marching order broke on the
ear. Came nearer and nearer from direction of dining-room; swinging
doors flung open; Colonel of the Queen's Westminster Volunteers
entered. Behind him, in close order, tramped something like score of
members. At word of command they took half turn to right and passed
into House, as in earlier days another British column swung through the
gates of Delhi.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, more than half the force were observed to come out
of the House, look furtively round, and dash off in various directions,
some to smoking-room, some to reading-room, and some clear off the
premises. But they had done their appointed work, and <span class="smcap">Howard
Vincent</span>, an old campaigner, had secured opportunity for delivering
his speech on hostile tariffs and bounties.</p>

<p>Grave doubt at morning sitting whether House could be made for the
alluring joy. <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> took up position in lobby much as
recruiting-sergeant shows himself near Trafalgar Square. Accosted all
Members passing by. Offered them free rations and front seats for the
lecture if they would stay. Soon picked up enough men to reduce chances
of count out. Dinner, I am told, a little exciting, especially towards
the end. Several Members discovered straying towards the door. But the
ex-captain, of the Royal Berks Militia not to be trifled with. Kept
them together past the cheese; delivered every man in the House one
minute and thirty seconds before the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> took the Chair.
If any skulked out when the Colonel was once embarked on his lecture
he, of course, couldn't interfere. But they mustn't suppose their
departure wasn't marked. No more free rations for them.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;By reason of <span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman's</span> great
persuasiveness men and money for Army voted at morning sitting.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Seaside Mem.</span>&mdash;The Society recently started to abolish
Tide-houses will not include Bathing Machines within the scope of its
operations.</p>
